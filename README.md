# MyReads Project

This app allows you to keep track of your reading. The starter template for the project is Provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). The app helps your reading by dividing your books into `Currently Reading`, `Want To Read`, `Read` or `None`.

## How to install the app
Download or clone this git.
In your terminal dir yourself into the project dir and type in:
```
npm install
npm start
```
> If you are using `yarn`, you can use `yarn install` and `yarn start` instead of using `npm`!

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
